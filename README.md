# Labyrinth Escape Game

Welcome to the Labyrinth Escape Game! This simple and entertaining game challenges you to navigate through a labyrinth, avoid the evil dragon, and reach the exit as quickly as possible.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** Reach the top right corner of the labyrinth as fast as you can, avoiding the evil dragon.
2. **Movement:** Use the WASD keys to move the player character. Navigate left (A), right (D), up (W), or down (S).
3. **Dragon Movement:** The dragon starts at a random position and moves randomly until it reaches a wall. If the dragon gets to a neighboring field of the player, you lose!
4. **Visibility:** You can see only the neighboring fields at a distance of 3 units.
5. **Game Levels:** The game features multiple levels. Predefined levels are provided, ensuring they are playable. You can create additional levels or load them from files.
6. **Timer:** Each game has a timer that counts the elapsed time since the start of the game level.
7. **Highscore:** Record how many labyrinths you solve. If you lose, your score is saved in the highscore table.
